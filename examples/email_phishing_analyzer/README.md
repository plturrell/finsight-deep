- **Custom Plugin System:** Developers can bring in new tools using plugins.
- **High-level API:** Enables defining functions that transform into asynchronous LangChain tools.
- **Agentic Workflows:** Fully configurable via YAML for flexibility and productivity.
- **Ease of Use:** Simplifies developer experience and deployment.


## Installation and Setup

If you have not already done so, follow the instructions in the [Install Guide](../../docs/source/quick-start/installing.md#install-from-source) to create the development environment and install AIQ Toolkit.

### Install this Workflow:

From the root directory of the AIQ Toolkit library, run the following commands:

```bash
uv pip install -e examples/email_phishing_analyzer
```

### Set Up API Keys
If you have not already done so, follow the [Obtaining API Keys](../../docs/source/quick-start/installing.md#obtaining-api-keys) instructions to obtain an NVIDIA API key. You need to set your NVIDIA API key as an environment variable to access NVIDIA AI services:

```bash
export NVIDIA_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY>
```

## Example Usage

### Run the Workflow

Run the following command from the root of the AIQ Toolkit repo to execute this workflow with the specified input:

```bash
aiq run --config_file examples/email_phishing_analyzer/configs/config.yml --input "Dear [Customer], Thank you for your purchase on [Date]. We have processed a refund of $[Amount] to your account. Please provide your account and routing numbers so we can complete the transaction. Thank you, [Your Company]"
```

**Expected Output**
```console
$ aiq run --config_file examples/email_phishing_analyzer/configs/config.yml --input "Dear [Customer], Thank you for your purchase on [Date]. We have processed a refund of $[Amount] to your account. Please provide your account and routing numbers so we can complete the transaction. Thank you, [Your Company]"

[AGENT]
Agent input: Dear [Customer], Thank you for your purchase on [Date]. We have processed a refund of 0 to your account. Please provide your account and routing numbers so we can complete the transaction. Thank you, [Your Company]
Agent's thoughts:
Thought: This email seems suspicious as it asks for sensitive information such as account and routing numbers. I should analyze it for signs of phishing.

Action: email_phishing_analyzer
Action Input: {'text': 'Dear [Customer], Thank you for your purchase on [Date]. We have processed a refund of 0 to your account. Please provide your account and routing numbers so we can complete the transaction. Thank you, [Your Company]'}

Calling tools: email_phishing_analyzer
Tool's input: {"text": "Dear [Customer], Thank you for your purchase on [Date]. We have processed a refund of 0 to your account. Please provide your account and routing numbers so we can complete the transaction. Thank you, [Your Company]"}
Tool's response:
{"is_likely_phishing": true, "explanation": "The email exhibits suspicious signals that may indicate phishing. Specifically, the email requests sensitive personal information (account and routing numbers) under the guise of completing a refund transaction. Legitimate companies typically do not request such information via email, as it is a security risk. Additionally, the refund amount of '0' is unusual and may be an attempt to create a sense of urgency or confusion. The tone of the email is also somewhat generic and lacks personalization, which is another common trait of phishing emails."}

Final Answer: This email is likely a phishing attempt, as it requests sensitive personal information and exhibits other suspicious signals.

## Deployment-Oriented Setup

For a production deployment, use Docker:

### Build the Docker Image

Prior to building the Docker image ensure that you have followed the steps in the [Installation and Setup](#installation-and-setup) section, and you are currently in the AIQ Toolkit virtual environment.

From the root directory of the Simple Calculator repository, build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build --build-arg AIQ_VERSION=$(python -m setuptools_scm) -t email_phishing_analyzer -f examples/email_phishing_analyzer/Dockerfile .
```

### Run the Docker Container
Deploy the container:

```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 -e NVIDIA_API_KEY email_phishing_analyzer
```

### Test the API
Use the following curl command to test the deployed API:

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://localhost:8000/generate' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"input_message": "Dear [Customer], Thank you for your purchase on [Date]. We have processed a refund of $[Amount] to your account. Please provide your account and routing numbers so we can complete the transaction. Thank you, [Your Company]"}'
  ```

### Expected API Output
The API response should look like this:

```bash
{"value":"This email is likely a phishing attempt. It requests sensitive information, such as account and routing numbers, which is a common tactic used by scammers. The email also lacks specific details about the purchase, which is unusual for a refund notification. Additionally, the greeting is impersonal, which suggests a lack of personalization. It is recommended to be cautious when responding to such emails and to verify the authenticity of the email before providing any sensitive information."}
```
