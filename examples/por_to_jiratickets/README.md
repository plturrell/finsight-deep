# A Simple Jira Agent that Extracts POR and creates tickets

A minimal example demonstrating an end-to-end Jira ticket creating agentic workflow. This workflow leverages the AIQ Toolkit plugin system to integrate pre-built and custom tools into the workflow. Key elements are summarized below:

## Key Features

- **Pre-built Tools:** Leverages core AIQ Toolkit library tools.
- **Custom Plugin System:** Developers can bring in new tools using plugins.
- **High-level API:** Enables defining functions that transform into asynchronous LangChain tools.
- **Agentic Workflows:** Fully configurable via YAML for flexibility and productivity.
- **Ease of Use:** Simplifies developer experience and deployment.
- **Jira Agent Tool Call:** Following tools are available for the agent to extract POR, create and get Jira tickets.
   - `create_jira_ticket`()`: This function creates Jira ticket using the REST API. It requires specifying the project key, Jira token, Jira username, domain, and also ticket type (e.g., Bug, Task, Story), description and priority. Upon successful creation, it returns the ticket ID and URL.
   -  `extract_from_por_tool`: Extract epics, tasks, features and bugs from the given PRO/PRD file using the LLM chain and store the result. Assigns story points for each type based on complexity/effort and also fills in description for each.
   -  `get_jira_tickets_tool`: This function retrieves existing Jira tickets based on a JQL (Jira Query Language) filter. It fetches relevant information like ticket summary, status, and assignee. The returned data can be used for tracking or reporting.


## Installation and Setup

If you have not already done so, follow the instructions in the [Install Guide](../../docs/source/quick-start/installing.md#install-from-source) to create the development environment and install AIQ Toolkit.

### Install this Workflow:

From the root directory of the AIQ Toolkit library, run the following commands:

```bash
uv pip install -e examples/por_to_jiratickets
```

### Set Up API Keys
If you have not already done so, follow the [Obtaining API Keys](../../docs/source/quick-start/installing.md#obtaining-api-keys) instructions to obtain an NVIDIA API key. You need to set your NVIDIA API key as an environment variable to access NVIDIA AI services:

```bash
export NVIDIA_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY>
export JIRA_USERID=<YOUR_JIRA_USERNAME>
export JIRA_TOKEN=<YOUR_JIRA_TOKEN>
```

Steps to create a Jira token: Go to `User Profile` -> `API token authentication`-> `Creat a new API token`

### Update `Config.yml` with Jira domain and PROJECT KEY
```
    jira_domain: "https://<YOUR_COMPANY_DOMAIN>.com"
    jira_project_key: "<YOUR_JIRA_PROJECTKEY>"
```

### Human in the Loop (HITL) Configuration
It is often helpful, or even required, to have human input during the execution of an agent workflow. For example, to ask about preferences, confirmations, or to provide additional information.
The AIQ Toolkit library provides a way to add HITL interaction to any tool or function, allowing for the dynamic collection of information during the workflow execution, without the need for coding it
into the agent itself. For instance, this example asks for user permission to create Jira issues and tickets before creating them. We can view the implementation in the
`aiq_por_to_jiratickets.jira_tickets_tool.py` file. The implementation is below:

```python
@register_function(config_type=CreateJiraToolConfig)
async def create_jira_tickets_tool(config: CreateJiraToolConfig, builder: Builder):

    async def _arun(input_text: str) -> str:

        # Get user confirmation first
        try:
            aiq_context = AIQContext.get()
            user_input_manager = aiq_context.user_interaction_manager

            prompt = ("I would like to create Jira tickets for the extracted data. "
                      "Please confirm if you would like to proceed. Respond with 'yes' or 'no'.")

            human_prompt_text = HumanPromptText(text=prompt, required=True, placeholder="<your response here>")

            response = await user_input_manager.prompt_user_input(human_prompt_text)

            response_text = response.content.text.lower()

            # Regex to see if the response has yes in it
            # Set value to True if the response is yes
            import re
            selected_option = re.search(r'\b(yes)\b', response_text)
            if not selected_option:
                return "Did not receive user confirmation to upload to Jira. You can exit with a final answer."

        except Exception as e:
            logger.error("An error occurred when getting interaction content: %s", e)
            logger.info("Defaulting to not uploading to Jira")
            return ("Did not upload to Jira because human confirmation was not received. "
                    "You can exit with a final answer")

        logger.debug("Creating %s in Jira", input_text)
        # Rest of the function
```
As we see above, requesting user input using AIQ Toolkit is straightforward. We can use the `user_input_manager` to prompt the user for input. The user's response is then processed to determine the next steps in the workflow.
This can occur in any tool or function in the workflow, allowing for dynamic interaction with the user as needed.

## Example Usage

### Run the Workflow

Run the following command from the root of the AIQ Toolkit repo to execute this workflow with the specified input:

```bash
aiq run --config_file examples/por_to_jiratickets/configs/config.yml  --input "Can you extract por file por_requirements.txt, assign story points and create jira tickets for epics first and then followed by tasks?"
```

**Expected Output When Giving Permission**

```console
$ aiq run --config_file examples/por_to_jiratickets/configs/config.yml  --input "Can you extract por file por_requirements.txt, assign story points and create jira tickets for epics first and then followed by tasks?"
