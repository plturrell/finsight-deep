# AIQ Profiler Agent

You can talk to the traces generated by AIQ Toolkit workflows using this profiler agent example.


## Installation and Setup

If you have not already done so, follow the instructions in the [Install Guide](../../docs/source/quick-start/installing.md) to create the development environment and install AIQ Toolkit.

### Install this Workflow:

From the root directory of the AIQ Toolkit library, run the following commands:

```bash
uv pip install -e examples/profiler_agent
```

### Set Up API Keys
If you have not already done so, follow the [Obtaining API Keys](../../docs/source/quick-start/installing.md#obtaining-api-keys) instructions to obtain an NVIDIA API key. You need to set your NVIDIA API key as an environment variable to access NVIDIA AI services:

```bash
export NVIDIA_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY>
```

## Usage

1. Start the Phoenix server if not already running. If you are using a remote Phoenix server, you can skip this step and modify the config/config.yml to point to the URL.
```
docker run -p 6006:6006 -p 4317:4317 -i -t arizephoenix/phoenix:latest
```

2. Ensure that there are traces in the Phoenix server. You can use the simple calculator example to generate traces.
```
aiq run --config_file examples/simple_calculator/configs/config-tracing.yml --input "Is the product of 2 * 4 greater than the current hour of the day?"
aiq run --config_file examples/simple_calculator/configs/config-tracing.yml --input "Is the product of 33 * 4 greater than the current hour of the day?"
aiq run --config_file examples/simple_calculator/configs/config-tracing.yml --input "Is the sum of 44 and 55 greater than the current hour of the day?"
aiq run --config_file examples/simple_calculator/configs/config-tracing.yml --input "Is the difference between 7 and 5 less than the current hour of the day?"
```

3. Run the profiler agent:
   ```
   aiq serve --config_file=examples/profiler_agent/configs/config.yml
   ```

4. Launch the AIQ Toolkit User Interface by using the instructions in the [Launching the API Server and User Interface](../../docs/source/quick-start/launching-ui.md) guide.

5. Query the agent with natural language via the UI:
```
"Show me the token usage of last run"
```

![Sample Response](../../docs/source/_static/profiler-agent.png "Sample Response UI Image")

More examples:
   ```
   "Show me flowchart of last 3 runs"
   "Analyze the last 2 runs"
   ```

## Features

- Query Phoenix traces with natural language
- Analyze LLM application performance metrics
- Generate trace visualizations
- Extract user queries across trace spans
