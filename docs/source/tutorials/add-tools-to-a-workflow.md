# Add Tools to a Workflow

The [Customizing a Workflow](./customize-a-workflow.md) tutorial demonstrates how to customize a workflow by overriding parameters. This tutorial will demonstrate how to add new tools to a workflow. Adding a new tool to a workflow requires copying and modifying the workflow configuration file, which, in effect, creates a new customized workflow.

AIQ Toolkit includes several built-in tools (functions) that can be used in any workflow. To query for a list of installed tools, run the following command:
```bash
aiq info components -t function
```

The current workflow defines a tool to query the [LangSmith User Guide](https://docs.smith.langchain.com). This is defined in the `tools` section of the configuration file:
```yaml
functions:
  webpage_query:
    _type: webpage_query
    webpage_url: https://docs.smith.langchain.com
    description: "Search for information about LangSmith. For any questions about LangSmith, you must use this tool!"
    embedder_name: nv-embedqa-e5-v5
    chunk_size: 512
```

However, the workflow is unaware of some related technologies, such as LangGraph, if you run:
```bash
aiq run --config_file examples/simple/configs/config.yml --input "How does LangSmith interact with tools like LangGraph?"
```

The output will be similar to the following:
```
Workflow Result:
["Unfortunately, I couldn't find any information about LangSmith's interaction with LangGraph. The user guide does not mention LangGraph, and I couldn't find any relevant information through the webpage queries."]
```

You can solve this by updating the workflow to also query the [LangGraph Quickstart](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/introduction) guide.

To do this, create a copy of the original workflow configuration file. To add the LangGraph query tool to the workflow, update the YAML file updating the `functions` section from:
```yaml
functions:
  webpage_query:
    _type: webpage_query
    webpage_url: https://docs.smith.langchain.com
    description: "Search for information about LangSmith. For any questions about LangSmith, you must use this tool!"
    embedder_name: nv-embedqa-e5-v5
    chunk_size: 512
```

to:
```yaml
functions:
  langsmith_query:
    _type: webpage_query
    webpage_url: https://docs.smith.langchain.com
    description: "Search for information about LangSmith. For any questions about LangSmith, you must use this tool!"
    embedder_name: nv-embedqa-e5-v5
    chunk_size: 512
  langgraph_query:
    _type: webpage_query
    webpage_url: https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/introduction
    description: "Search for information about LangGraph. For any questions about LangGraph, you must use this tool!"
    embedder_name: nv-embedqa-e5-v5
    chunk_size: 512
```

Since you now have two instances of the `webpage_query` tool, you need to update the name of the first tool to `langsmith_query`.

Finally, update the `workflow.tool_names` section to include the new tool from:
```yaml
workflow:
  _type: react_agent
  tool_names: [webpage_query, current_datetime]
```

to:
```yaml
workflow:
  _type: react_agent
  tool_names: [langsmith_query, langgraph_query, current_datetime]
```

:::{note}
The resulting YAML is located at `examples/documentation_guides/workflows/custom_workflow/custom_config.yml` in the AIQ Toolkit repository.
:::

When you rerun the workflow with the updated configuration file:
```bash
aiq run --config_file examples/documentation_guides/workflows/custom_workflow/custom_config.yml \
  --input "How does LangSmith interact with tools like LangGraph?"
```

We should receive output similar to:
```
Workflow Result:
['LangSmith interacts with LangGraph as part of an out-of-the-box solution for building complex, production-ready features with LLMs. LangGraph works in conjunction with LangSmith to provide this solution, and they are both part of the LangChain ecosystem.']
```

## Alternate Method Using a Web Search Tool
Adding individual web pages to a workflow can be cumbersome, especially when dealing with multiple web pages. An alternative method is to use a web search tool. One of the tools available in AIQ Toolkit is the `tavily_internet_search` tool, which utilizes the [Tavily Search API](https://tavily.com/).

The `tavily_internet_search` tool is part of the `aiqtoolkit[langchain]` package, to install the package run:
```bash
# local package install from source
uv pip install -e '.[langchain]'
```

Prior to using the `tavily_internet_search` tool, create an account at [`tavily.com`](https://tavily.com/) and obtain an API key. Once obtained, set the `TAVILY_API_KEY` environment variable to the API key:
```bash
export TAVILY_API_KEY=<YOUR_TAVILY_API_KEY>
```

We will now update the `functions` section of the configuration file replacing the two `webpage_query` tools with a single `tavily_internet_search` tool entry:
```yaml
functions:
  internet_search:
    _type: tavily_internet_search
  current_datetime:
    _type: current_datetime
```

Next, update the `workflow.tool_names` section to include the new tool:
```yaml
workflow:
  _type: react_agent
  tool_names: [internet_search, current_datetime]
```

The resulting configuration file is located at `examples/documentation_guides/workflows/custom_workflow/search_config.yml` in the AIQ Toolkit repository.

When you re-run the workflow with the updated configuration file:
```bash
aiq run --config_file examples/documentation_guides/workflows/custom_workflow/search_config.yml \
  --input "How does LangSmith interact with tools like LangGraph?"
```

Which will then yield a slightly different result to the same question:
```
Workflow Result:
['LangSmith interacts with LangGraph through the LangChain ecosystem, which provides the foundation for building LLM applications. LangGraph provides real-time monitoring, tracing, and debugging capabilities, and it can be used in conjunction with LangSmith to build robust agentic applications.']
```
