# Contributing to NVIDIA Agent Intelligence Toolkit

Contributions to AIQ Toolkit fall into the following three categories.

* To report a bug, request a new feature, or report a problem with
   documentation, file a [bug](https://github.com/NVIDIA/AIQToolkit/issues/new/choose)
    describing in detail the problem or new feature. The AIQ Toolkit team evaluates
    and triages bugs and schedules them for a release. If you believe the
    bug needs priority attention, comment on the bug to notify the
    team.
* To propose and implement a new Feature, file a new feature request
    [issue](https://github.com/NVIDIA/AIQToolkit/issues/new/choose). Describe the
    intended feature and discuss the design and implementation with the team and
    community. Once the team agrees that the plan is good, go ahead and
    implement it, using the [code contributions](#code-contributions) guide below.
* To implement a feature or bug-fix for an existing outstanding issue,
    follow the [code contributions](#code-contributions) guide below. If you
    need more context on a particular issue, ask in a comment.

As contributors and maintainers of AIQ Toolkit, you are expected to abide by the AIQ Toolkit code of conduct. More information can be found at: [Contributor Code of Conduct](./code-of-conduct.md).

## Set Up Your Development Environment
### Prerequisites

- Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- Install [Git Large File Storage](https://git-lfs.github.com/) (LFS)
- Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)
- Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (recommended)

AIQ Toolkit is a Python library that doesnâ€™t require a GPU to run the workflow by default. You can deploy the core workflows using one of the following:
- Ubuntu or other Linux distributions, including WSL, in a Python virtual environment.

### Creating the Environment

1. Fork the AIQ Toolkit repository choosing **Fork** on the [AIQ Toolkit repository page](https://github.com/NVIDIA/AIQToolkit).

1. Clone your personal fork of the AIQ Toolkit repository to your local machine.
    ```bash
    git clone <your fork url> aiqtoolkit
    cd aiqtoolkit
    ```

    Then, set the upstream to the main repository and fetch the latest changes:
    ```bash
    git remote add upstream git@github.com:NVIDIA/AIQToolkit.git
    git fetch --all
    ```


1. Initialize, fetch, and update submodules in the Git repository.
    ```bash
    git submodule update --init --recursive
    ```

1. Fetch the data sets by downloading the LFS files.
    ```bash
    git lfs install
    git lfs fetch
    git lfs pull
    ```

1. Create a Python environment.
    ```bash
    uv venv --seed .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    uv sync --all-groups --all-extras
    ```

1. Install and configure pre-commit hooks.

    ```bash
    pre-commit install
    ```
    **NOTE**: Running pre-commit for the first time will take longer than normal.

7. Open the AIQ Toolkit Workspace in Visual Studio Code.
    ```bash
    code ./aiq.code-workspace
    ```

### Install the AIQ Toolkit Library

1. Install the AIQ Toolkit Examples by doing the following.
   - Install AIQ Toolkit examples.

     ```bash
     uv sync --extra examples
     ```
   - Install a single example by running `uv pip install -e ./examples/<example_name>`.
   For example, install the Simple Calculator example with the following command.

     ```bash
     uv pip install -e ./examples/simple_calculator
     ```

2. Verify that you've installed the AIQ Toolkit library.

     ```bash
     aiq --help
     aiq --version
     ```

     If the installation succeeded, the `aiq` command will log the help message and its current version.


## Code contributions

### Your first issue

1. Find an issue to work on. The best way is to search for issues with the [good first issue](https://github.com/NVIDIA/AIQToolkit/issues) label.
1. Make sure that you can contribute your work to open source (no license and/or patent conflict is introduced by your code). You will need to [`sign`](#signing-your-work) your commit.
1. Comment on the issue stating that you are going to work on it.
1. [Fork the AIQ Toolkit repository](https://github.com/NVIDIA/AIQToolkit/fork)
1. Code!
    - Make sure to update unit tests!
    - Ensure the [license headers are set properly](./licensing.md).
1. Verify your changes by [running CI locally](./running-ci-locally.md) with the `./ci/scripts/run_ci_local.sh all` command.
1. When done, [create your pull request](https://github.com/NVIDIA/AIQToolkit/compare). Select `develop` as the `Target branch` of your pull request.
    - Ensure the body of the pull request references the issue you are working on in the form of `Closes #<issue number>`.
1. Wait for other developers to review your code and update code as needed.
1. Once reviewed and approved, an AIQ Toolkit developer will merge your pull request.

Remember, if you are unsure about anything, don't hesitate to comment on issues and ask for clarifications!

### Signing Your Work

* We require that all contributors "sign-off" on their commits. This certifies that the contribution is your original work, or you have rights to submit it under the same license, or a compatible license.

  * Any contribution which contains commits that are not Signed-Off will not be accepted.

* To sign off on a commit you simply use the `--signoff` (or `-s`) option when committing your changes:
  ```bash
  $ git commit -s -m "Add cool feature."
  ```
  This will append the following to your commit message:
  ```
  Signed-off-by: Your Name <your@email.com>
  ```

* Full text of the DCO is available at [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org/)

### Seasoned developers

Once you have gotten your feet wet and are more comfortable with the code, you can review the prioritized issues for our next release in our [project boards](https://github.com/NVIDIA/AIQToolkit/projects).

> **Pro Tip:** Always review the release board with the highest number for issues to work on. This is where AIQ Toolkit developers also focus their efforts.

Review the unassigned issues and choose an issue that you are comfortable contributing. Ensure you comment on the issue before you begin to inform others that you are working on it. If you have questions about implementing the issue, comment your questions in the issue instead of the PR.

## Developing with AIQ Toolkit

Refer to the [Get Started](../quick-start/installing.md) guide to quickly begin development.

## Documentation

All Agent Intelligence Toolkit should be written in Markdown format. The documentation located under the `docs/source` directory is included in the documentation builds, refer to `docs/README.md` for information on how to build the documentation. In addition to this, each example should contain a `README.md` file that describes the example.

### Checks
All documentation is checked using [Vale](https://vale.sh/). In documentation the name of a command, variable, class, or function should be surrounded by backticks. For example referring `aiq` should always be surrounded by backticks. Vale will not perform a check against anything surrounded by backticks or by a code block.

The spelling of a project name should use the casing of the project, for example [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) should always be spelled as `PyPI` and not `pypi` or `PYPI`. If needed new words can be added to the `ci/vale/styles/config/vocabularies/aiq/accept.txt` and `ci/vale/styles/config/vocabularies/aiq/reject.txt` files.

### Agent Intelligence Toolkit Name Guidelines

* Full Name: `Agent Intelligence Toolkit`
  - Use for document titles, webpage headers, any public descriptions
* Short Name: `AIQ Toolkit`
  - Use after Agent Intelligence Toolkit has been referenced in blogs, docs, and other public locations
* Uppercase No Space: `AIQToolkit`
  - Use for situations where capitalization will be preserved like the GitHub URL, directories, etc.
  - Do not use dashes or underscores
* Lowercase No Space: `aiqtoolkit`
  - Use for URLs, PyPI package, any place where spaces are not allowed and casing is not preserved.
  - Do not use dashes or underscores
