# Observing a Workflow with W&B Weave

This guide provides a step-by-step process to enable observability in an AIQ Toolkit workflow using Weights and Biases (W&B) Weave for tracing using just a few lines of code in your workflow configuration file.

![Weave Tracing Dashboard](../../_static/weave_tracing.png)

### Step 1: Install the Weave plugin

To install the Weave plugin, run the following:

```bash
uv pip install -e '.[weave]'
```

### Step 2: Install the Workflow

Pick an example from the list of available workflows. In this guide, we will be using the `simple_calculator` example.

```bash
uv pip install -e examples/simple_calculator
```

### Step 3: Modify Workflow Configuration

Update your workflow configuration file to include the weave telemetry settings. For example, `examples/simple_calculator/configs/config-weave.yml` has the following weave settings:

```bash
general:
  use_uvloop: true
  telemetry:
    tracing:
      weave:
        _type: weave
        project: "aiqtoolkit-demo"
```

This setup enables logging trace data to W&B weave. The weave integration requires one parameter and one optional parameter:

| Parameter | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `project` | The name of your W&B Weave project | `"aiqtoolkit-demo"` |
| `entity` (optional) | Your W&B username or team name | `"your-wandb-username-or-teamname"` |

### Step 4: Run Your Workflow
Install `simple_calculator` example using the instructions in the `examples/simple_calculator/README.md` guide.
Run the workflow using `config-weave.yml` configuration file:

```bash
aiq run --config_file examples/simple_calculator/configs/config-weave.yml --input "Is the product of 2 * 4 greater than the current hour of the day?"
```

If it is your first time running the workflow, you will be prompted to login to W&B Weave.

### Step 5: View Traces Data in Weave Dashboard

As the workflow runs, you will find a Weave URL (starting with a üç© emoji). Click on the URL to access your logged trace timeline.

Note how the integration captures not only the `aiq` intermediate steps but also the underlying framework. This is because [Weave has integrations](https://weave-docs.wandb.ai/guides/integrations/) with many of your favorite frameworks.
