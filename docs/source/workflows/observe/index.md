# Observe Workflows

The AIQ Toolkit Observability Module provides support for configurable telemetry setup to do logging tracing and metrics for AIQ Toolkit workflows.
- Enables users to configure telemetry options from a predefined list based on their preferences.
- Listens real-time usage statistics pushed by `IntermediateStepManager`.
- Translates the usage statistics to OpenTelemetry format and push to the configured provider/method. (e.g., phoenix, OTelCollector, console, file)

These features enable AIQ Toolkit developers to test their workflows locally and integrate observability seamlessly.

## Installation

The core observability features (console and file logging) are included by default. For advanced telemetry features like OpenTelemetry and Phoenix tracing, you need to install the optional telemetry dependencies:

```bash
uv pip install -e '.[telemetry]'
```

This will install:
- OpenTelemetry API and SDK for distributed tracing
- Arize Phoenix for visualization and analysis of LLM traces

## Configurable Components

Users can set up telemetry configuration within the workflow configuration file.

### **Logging Configuration**
Users can write logs to:
- **Console** (`console`)
- **Temporary file** (`file`)
- **Both** (by specifying both options)

#### **Configuration Fields**
- **`_type`**: Accepted values â†’ `console`, `file`
- **`level`**: Log level (e.g., `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR`)
- **`path`** *(for file logging only)*: File path where logs will be stored.

### **Tracing Configuration**
Users can set up tracing using:
- **Phoenix** (requires `[telemetry]` extra)
- **Custom providers** *(See registration section below.)*

#### **Configuration Fields**
- **`_type`**: The name of the registered provider.
- **`endpoint`**: The provider's listening endpoint.
- **`project`**: The associated project name.


Sample Configuration:
```yaml
general:
  telemetry:
    logging:
      console:
        _type: console
        level: WARN
      file:
        _type: file
        path: /tmp/aiq_simple_calculator.log
        level: DEBUG
    tracing:
      phoenix:
        _type: phoenix
        endpoint: http://localhost:6006/v1/traces
        project: simple_calculator
```


### AIQ Toolkit Observability Components

The Observability components `AsyncOtelSpanListener`, leverage the Subject-Observer pattern to subscribe to the `IntermediateStep` event stream pushed by `IntermediateStepManager`. Acting as an asynchronous event listener, `AsyncOtelSpanListener` listens for AIQ Toolkit intermediate step events, collects and efficiently translates them into OpenTelemetry spans, enabling seamless tracing and monitoring.

- **Process events asynchronously** using a dedicated event loop.
- **Transform function execution boundaries** (`FUNCTION_START`, `FUNCTION_END`) and intermediate operations (`LLM_END`, `TOOL_END`) into OpenTelemetry spans.
- **Maintain function ancestry context** using `InvocationNode` objects, ensuring **distributed tracing across nested function calls**, while preserving execution hierarchy.
- **{py:class}`aiq.profiler.decorators`**: Defines decorators that can wrap each workflow or LLM framework context manager to inject usage-collection callbacks.
- **{py:class}`~aiq.profiler.callbacks`**: Directory that implements callback handlers. These handlers track usage statistics (tokens, time, inputs/outputs) and push them to the AIQ Toolkit usage stats queue. AIQ Toolkit profiling supports callback handlers for LangChain, LLama Index, CrewAI, and Semantic Kernel.


### Registering a New Telemetry Provider as a Plugin

AIQ Toolkit allows users to register custom telemetry providers using the `@register_telemetry_exporter` decorator in {py:class}`aiq.observability.register`.

Example:
```bash
class PhoenixTelemetryExporter(TelemetryExporterBaseConfig, name="phoenix"):
    endpoint: str
    project: str


@register_telemetry_exporter(config_type=PhoenixTelemetryExporter)
async def phoenix_telemetry_exporter(config: PhoenixTelemetryExporter, builder: Builder):

    from phoenix.otel import HTTPSpanExporter
    try:
        yield HTTPSpanExporter(endpoint=config.endpoint)
    except ConnectionError as ex:
        logger.warning("Unable to connect to Phoenix at port 6006. Are you sure Phoenix is running?\n %s",
                       ex,
                       exc_info=True)
    except Exception as ex:
        logger.error("Error in Phoenix telemetry Exporter\n %s", ex, exc_info=True)
```
