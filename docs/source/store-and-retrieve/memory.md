# NVIDIA Agent Intelligence Toolkit Memory Module

The AIQ Toolkit Memory subsystem is designed to store and retrieve a user's conversation history, preferences, and other "long-term memory." This is especially useful for building stateful LLM-based applications that recall user-specific data or interactions across multiple steps.

The memory module is designed to be extensible, allowing developers to create custom memory back-ends, providers in AIQ Toolkit terminology.

## Included Memory Modules
The AIQ Toolkit includes two memory module providers, both of which are available as plugins:
* [Mem0](https://mem0.ai/) which is provided by the [`aiqtoolkit-mem0ai`](https://pypi.org/project/aiqtoolkit-mem0ai/) plugin.
* [Zep](https://www.getzep.com/) which is provided by the [`aiqtoolkit-zep-cloud`](https://pypi.org/project/aiqtoolkit-zep-cloud/) plugin.

## Examples
The following examples demonstrate how to use the memory module in the AIQ Toolkit:
* `examples/simple_rag`
* `examples/semantic_kernel_demo`

## Additional Resources
For information on how to write a new memory module provider can be found in the [Adding a Memory Provider](../extend/memory.md) document.
