# Launching the NVIDIA Agent Intelligence Toolkit API Server and User Interface
AIQ Toolkit provides a user interface for interacting with your running workflow.

## User Interface Features
- Chat history
- Interact with Workflow via HTTP API
- Interact with Workflow via WebSocket
- Enable or disable Workflow intermediate steps
- Expand all Workflow intermediate steps by default
- Override intermediate steps with the same ID

## Walk-through
This walk-through guides you through the steps to set up and configure the AIQ toolkit user interface. Refer to `examples/simple_calculator/README.md` to set up the simple calculator workflow demonstrated in the following walk-through properly.


The AIQ Toolkit UI is located in a git submodule at `external/aiqtoolkit-opensource-ui`. Ensure you have checked out all of the
git submodules by running the following:
```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### Start the AIQ Toolkit Server
You can start the AIQ Toolkit server using the `aiq serve` command with the appropriate configuration file.

```bash
aiq serve --config_file=examples/simple_calculator/configs/config.yml
```
Running this command will produce the expected output as shown below:
```bash
2025-03-07 12:54:20,394 - aiq.cli.commands.start - INFO - Starting AIQ Toolkit from config file: 'examples/simple_calculator/configs/config.yml'
WARNING:  Current configuration will not reload as not all conditions are met, please refer to documentation.

```

### Verify the AIQ Toolkit Server is Running
After the server is running, you can make HTTP requests to interact with the workflow.

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url http://localhost:8000/generate \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "input_message": "Is 4 + 4 greater than the current hour of the day?",
    "use_knowledge_base": true
}'
```

Running this command will produce the following expected output:
> **Note:** The response depends on the current time of day the command executes.
```bash
{
  "value": "No, 8 is less than the current hour of the day (4)."
}
```

### Launch the AIQ Toolkit User Interface
After the AIQ Toolkit server starts, launch the web user interface. Launching the UI requires that Node.js v18+ is installed. Instructions for downloading and installing Node.js can be found in the official [Node.js documentation](https://nodejs.org/en/download).

```bash
cd external/aiqtoolkit-opensource-ui
npm install
npm run dev
```
After the web development server starts, open a web browser and navigate to [`http://localhost:3000/`](http://localhost:3000/).
Port `3001` is an alternative port if port `3000` (default) is in use.

### Connect the User Interface to the AIQ Toolkit Server Using HTTP API
Configure the settings by selecting the `Settings` icon located on the bottom left corner of the home page.

![AIQ Toolkit Web UI Settings](../_static/ui_generate_example_settings.png)

#### Settings Options
**Note:** It is recommended to select /chat/stream for intermediate results streaming.
- `Theme`: Light or Dark Theme.
- `HTTP URL for Chat Completion`: REST API enpoint.
  - /generate
  - /generate/stream
  - /chat
  - /chat/stream
- `WebSocket URL for Completion`: WebSocket URL to connect to running AIQ Toolkit server.
- `WebSocket Schema` - Workflow schema type over WebSocket connection.

### Simple Calculator Example Conversation
Interact with the chat interface by prompting the Agent with the
message: `Is 4 + 4 greater than the current hour of the day?`
