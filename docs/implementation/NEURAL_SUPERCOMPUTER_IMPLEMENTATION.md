# Single-node Multi-GPU workflow
from aiq.gpu import MultiGPUManager
from aiq.builder import DistributedWorkflowBuilder

# Get available GPUs
gpu_manager = MultiGPUManager()
print(f"Available GPUs: {gpu_manager.device_count}")

# Create basic distributed workflow
builder = DistributedWorkflowBuilder()
workflow = builder.build_from_config("config.yml")
results = await workflow.run()
```
